# Personal Portfolio Using React.js using Tailwind

Hello thanks for stopping by. 

I recently completed a 12 week Software Engineering Intentive. One of our first projects was to complete a portfolio using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

While that was a fun exersise and challening, as it was my first website, it was also over 4 months ago. [My Orginal Portfolio]() 

I was debating whether to update my original portfolio or create a new  and decided on the later. 

To spice things up I also decided to learn about tailwind which is something I recently stubbled upon the build out this app. 

Have a look around and tell me what you think. If you would like to connect all my info is on the home page. 


## Goals and Plan 

To create fully responsive portfoloi using React.js and Tailwind. I will also be adding a fully operable contact form.  

The milestones for this project is as follows: 

1) Create App
2) Build out structure
3) Add Sudo-text
4) Design 
5) Update with complete text
6) Debug
7) Deploy and share


### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
